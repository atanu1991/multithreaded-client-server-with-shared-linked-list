===================================================

Basic functionality of ECHO SERVER implemented.
Also template of LinkedList code included.

To Run it:
--> Git clone the repo.<br>
--> cd ~/multithreaded-client-server-with-shared-linked-list
--> Run 'make'
--> Run './serv <PORT NUMBER>' on one terminal window.
--> Fire up as many other terminal windows and run './cli <PORT NUMBER> [<IP ADDRESS>]'

1) Parse client side queries (using lex,yacc / bison,flex).
2) Perform operations on LinkedList using locks.

Please fell free to give as much fedback as possible.
